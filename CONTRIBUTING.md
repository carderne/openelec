# Contribution guidelines
We welcome any ideas, input, feedback, bug reporting and contributions. Although openelec is not feature complete, the immediate priority is to improve the API and documentation, and to squash whatever bugs are found. Apart from that, more eyes on the code (and its output) and ideas for improvements and fixes are extremely welcome.

## Technical
Development is in Python 3.6+ only. As the API is still in flux, currently the only test is a full integration test - improvements here would also be welcome! That said, please ensure that at least this one test passes: add your code (as needed) to `example.ipynb` and run `./test.sh`.
